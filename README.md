# Getting and Cleaning Data
## Course Project

## Introduction
This repository holds the raw data, a R script and processed data in tidy format.  The 

## Raw data
The raw data was generated from sensors inside a Samsung smartphone.  Human subjects performed various activities and their performance was logged.  

## Script
I created a script named run_analysis.R to aggregate the raw data, process and reformat the information and then generate a new data file.


## Processed data
The processed data named 'tidy.txt' is tidy.  It embodies all the major tidy principals extoled by data scientists around the globe such as:
* Each variable you measure should be in one column
* Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row
* There should be one table for each "kind" of variable

See the CodeBook.MD file for more information.

Peace out.
